## Title
Minting and Burning
## Description
This is an Ethereum smart contract implemented in Solidity that defines a basic token called "Chankit" with the symbol "CHC". The contract allows minting and burning of tokens.
## Deployment
Using Remix:

1. Open Remix.
Create a new file and paste the contract code.
Compile the contract.
Deploy the contract using an injected web3 provider (e.g., MetaMask).

2. Using Truffle:

Initialize a Truffle project.
Create a new file in the contracts directory and paste the contract code.
Compile and deploy the contract using Truffle commands.
